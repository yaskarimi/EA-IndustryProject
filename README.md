## Problem Space
Gaming has been a popular activity for a long
time and there is no end in site.
As technology and creativity continues to evolve,
so does the gaming space.
One area that we’ve seen grow in many ways in
the last decade is interaction between gamers -
both in person at events and online in games and
other platforms.
People create entire communities around specific
games and gaming in general.
New ways of interacting with others through
gaming is top of mind in the industry.
Online video games allow some people to interact
with each other in ways they may not be able to
without games.
The gaming industry wants to make sure
interactions in and about their products are safe,
fun and accessible.



## Challenge Statement
How might we… enhance interaction
between gamers?
